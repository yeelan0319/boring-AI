# Basic Knowledge
There are some basic knowldge which we use everyday but we seldom consider theri imprtance clearly. Here are some trivial tips for machine leatning

1. IDE recommendation: VScode
    This must be the best IDE for every reason. After install python extension and jupyter it is so cool. However, you do need some time to configure $PATH for python and pytorch library.

2. Install Cuda and Cudnn
    This can be total disaster in ubuntu 16.04. Many tutorials are worng and you have to carefully install NVIDIA driver with none-graph terminal and invalid secure boot. However, everything seems to be so easy in ubuntu 17.04 version, the only difference is that you have to configure PATH and source it for cudnn installation.

3. Do learn computational graph and backpropagation. There are so basic and important!
